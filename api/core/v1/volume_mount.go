	// mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host to container and the other way around. When not set, MountPropagationNone is used. This field is beta in 1.10.

	// If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

	// If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

	SubPath string `json:"subPath,omitempty"`
