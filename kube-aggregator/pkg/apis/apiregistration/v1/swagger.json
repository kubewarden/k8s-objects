In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is \"kube-like\", it will sort above non \"kube-like\" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. \"Kube-like\" versions start with a \"v\", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string \"alpha\" or \"beta\" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA \u003e beta \u003e alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.","type":"integer","format":"int32"}}},"APIServiceStatus":{"description":"APIServiceStatus contains derived information about an API server","type":"object","properties":{"conditions":{"description":"Current service state of apiService.","type":"array","items":{"x-nullable":true,"x-omitempty":true,"$ref":"#/definitions/APIServiceCondition"},"x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key":"type","x-kubernetes-patch-strategy":"merge","x-omitempty":true}}},"ServiceReference":{"description":"ServiceReference holds a reference to Service.legacy.k8s.io","type":"object","properties":{"name":{"description":"Name is the name of the service","type":"string","x-omitempty":true},"namespace":{"description":"Namespace is the namespace of the service","type":"string","x-omitempty":true}}}}}
